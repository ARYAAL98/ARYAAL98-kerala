        <h1>Facts about Kozhikodu</h1>
        <p>
            Kozhikode is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was a significant spice 
            trade center and is close to Kappad Beach, where Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama 
            landed in 1498. The central Kozhikode Beach, overlooked by an old lighthouse, is a popular spot  
            for watching the sunset. Inland, tree-lined Mananchira 
             Square, with its musical fountain, surrounds the massive Mananchira Tank, an artificial pond.

            <img id="id2" src="images/thusharagiri.koz.jpg">
            <p>
                A place where two streams merge to become 
                a river – Chalippuzha river- water cannot stop from leaping over rocky hills, just once. A 
                trek starts from the hanging bridge, goes further up, from where you found this stream, get
                 your gear ready for the real adventures, as Thusharagiri has only begun. Further inside the
                  woods, more waterfalls wait for your dip. They are the Eerattumukku, Mazhavil Chattam and 
                  Thumpithullum para waterfall, the real gem which is hidden deep in the trail.  
                On the trail one can meet Thanni Muthassi or the Grandmother Thanni, a Thanni tree 
                (Bedda Nut Tree) which is believed to be 400 years old. Hollow inside, Thanni Muthassi 
                can accommodate 3 persons at a time.
                Ready for a day’s hike like that? Here’s the reward. At the end of the day,
                 you’d reach Vythiri up the Ghats at Wayanad!

            <p>
Kappad, or Kappakadavu locally, is a beach near Koyilandy, in the district Kozhikode, Kerala, India.
        A stone monument installed by government commemorates the "landing" by Vasco da Gama
         with the inscription, 'Vasco da Gama landed here, Kappakadavu, in the year 1498'.
        In 2007 a Rs. 1.5 crore program to beautify the beach was launched by [Kerala] 
        Tourism Minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. It is now completed and Kappad beach has a corniche 
        and park. The park includes a restroom, restaurant and seating.[2]
        The nearest major railway station is Koyilandy, about 10 km away from Kappad.
         The nearest airport is Calicut International Airport (CCJ), which is about 25 km from the town of Kozhikode. Private transport buses are available from
         the main bus stand, or visitors can reach the beach by stopping at Thiruvangoor on National
          Highway 66</p>
