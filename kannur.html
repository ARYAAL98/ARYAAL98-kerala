            <h1>Facts about kannur</h1>
            <p>
                Kannur is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was once
                 an ancient trading port. Enduring monuments such as 16th-century St. Angelo Fort, 
                 once occupied by European colonial forces, show the city’s significant role in the spice
                 trade. Housed in a former palace, the Arakkal Museum highlights Kerala's 
                one Muslim royal family. The palm-fringed sands of Payyambalam Beach run along Kannur’s western shore.

                <p>
                    In 1498, during Vasco da Gama's visit to India, the local Kolathiri
                     king granted the land to Portuguese to build a settlement in present-day Kerala. 
                     On 23 October 1505, he gave the Portuguese leader Francisco de Almeida the permission to 
                     build a fort at the site. The construction activity began the very next day, on 24 October
                      1505, when Goncalo Gil Barbosa - the Portuguese factor of Cannanore (Kannur) - laid the
                       foundation stone. The construction of the wooden fort was completed on 30 October 1505: its 
                       first Captain was Lourenco Britto, who led a garrison of 150 Portuguese men, and controlled two 
                       ships in the sea. After the fort was completed, Almeida began
                     using the title "Viceroy", and in 1507, he started the construction of a stone fort at the site.
