            Kozhikode is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was a significant spice 
            trade center and is close to Kappad Beach, where Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed 
            in 1498. The central Kozhikode Beach, overlooked by an old lighthouse, is a popular spot
             for watching the sunset. Inland, tree-lined Mananchira
             Square, with its musical fountain, surrounds the massive Mananchira Tank, an artificial pond.
